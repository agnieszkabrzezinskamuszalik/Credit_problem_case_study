In everyday tasks it is easy to find problems containing a lot of collected data with a small amount of interesting outliers. 
In this case, the problem of granting loans was examined where one group was significantly larger than the other.
Logistic regression and random forest methods were used with the option of data balancing. For comparison, the same process was carried out without using the balanced option. 
The results without the balanced option were significantly worse than those with the balanced option. 
Random forest as a method resistant to low-leveling of groups in itself fared better than logistic regression, however the calculations took significantly longer for a similar number of observed cases. 
It also presents how to process various types of provided data and create pipelines that allow the introduction of ready-made solutions in a production environment.
